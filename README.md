emForth
=======

This is an implementation of forth written in C, as a hobby project to learn
about forth. Jonesforth has been used as the biggest reference. A few starting goals about this project:

- easy to target on multiple architectures without focusing on being
  portable to several compilers
- embeddable in other code, including on microcontrollers
- readability

Note that this forth isn't complete, however the core of this forth is
functional.


## Compiling and running
